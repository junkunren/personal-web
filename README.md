# About

I am currently working with [Dr. Shaopeng Wang](http://scholar.pku.edu.cn/spwang) at the Theoretical Ecology Group at Peking University in Beijing, China and  working on a project previously initiated at Dartmouth College with [Dr. Dorothy Wallace](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~dwallace/). I am particularly passionate about understanding models and theories related to ecology and biology. My research interests include food-webs, coexistence, and stability. I am also interested in applying mathematical modeling to questions like infectious disease transmission intervention.

Prior to working at the theoretical ecology lab at Peking University, I worked as a research assistant at the Space Medicine Lab at Dartmouth College, doing data and epidemiological analyses. I studied epidmeiology at Harvard University and food science & engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong Univerisity, during which I developed good quantitative skills.
